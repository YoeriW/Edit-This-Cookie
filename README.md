# EditThisCookie (Fork)

**EditThisCookie** is a powerful and simple cookie manager for Chromium browsers. Originally inspired by the lack of solid cookie management tools, this fork brings the beloved functionality of the original [EditThisCookie](https://github.com/fcapano/EditThisCookie) into the modern web with support for **Manifest V3 and up** — plus many improvements and fixes.

## 🔧 What You Can Do
- ✅ Add, edit, delete, and search cookies  
- 🔒 Protect cookies (read-only)  
- 🚫 Block cookies via filters  
- 📤 Export cookies in JSON, Netscape format (great for `wget`/`curl`), or Perl::LPW  
- 📥 Import cookies in JSON  
- ⏳ Limit the max expiration date of cookies  

## 🎉 New in This Fork
- Updated to **Manifest V3**
- Refreshed packages: jQuery, jQueryUI, Font Awesome
- Built-in **Dark Theme** support
- Improved UI styling for user preferences
- Many **bug fixes** (JavaScript errors, layout issues)
- Merged helpful community PRs from the original repo
